# Airline - Unsupervised Machine Learning (Clustering K-MEANS & PCA)

## Performing an airline and passengers clustering analysis using K-means and PCA involves several steps. Below is a general outline of the process:

### 1. Collect the dataset

### 2. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, normalizing or standardizing the data, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.

### 3. PCA (Principal Component Analysis):
- Apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving the most important information. This step helps in extracting the principal components that explain the maximum variance in the dataset.
- Determine the optimal number of principal components to retain using techniques such as scree plot or cumulative explained variance.

### 4. K-means Clustering:
- Apply K-means clustering to the reduced dataset from the PCA step. Choose the appropriate number of clusters based on domain knowledge or using techniques like the elbow method or silhouette analysis.
- Implement the K-means algorithm to group the data points into clusters based on the similarities between them.

### 5. Analysis and Interpretation:
Analyze the clusters obtained to understand the characteristics of each cluster in terms of airline and passenger behavior, preferences, or other relevant factors.
Visualize the clusters using appropriate plots such as scatter plots, cluster profiles, or any other suitable visualization techniques.
Interpret the results to gain insights into passenger segmentation, flight route optimization, or any other relevant business objectives.

### 7. Evaluation and Refinement:
Evaluate the performance of the clustering model using internal metrics such as inertia or silhouette score and external validation metrics if ground truth is available.
Refine the analysis by tweaking the parameters of the PCA and K-means algorithms if necessary to improve the clustering results.

### 9. Implementation and Reporting:
Implement the insights gained from the analysis to improve airline services, passenger experiences, marketing strategies, or any other relevant aspects.
Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the entire analysis, including the data preprocessing steps, PCA results, clustering outcomes, and actionable insights for stakeholders.
